How to use it?
* Open src/index.html
* Then in case you want to add some task to some definite day you should click on that day, 
then enter your text (not empty) and click Enter. (This is only one of many kinds of realizations such logic)

What was implemented?
* Switch between a month and years (but it can be improved too :))
* Store for the local item, at least between switching  months and years
* Showing weeks days, weekends and current day
* Showing current year and month
* Ability to add some tasks to a definite day

I don't implement all that I want in recruiter reason that asked me to finish it to this today(2020/August/07 - 01:00 pm),
In general here the list of things that can be improved:
 * Real DB, to store the data, or use localStorage(for a store that will not delete data on page refresh, close and so on)
 * Add more styles, effects, animations, but this is a matter of taste, and I believe that it can be better as now
 * Add i18n
 * CRUD for todos in days (now we can do only creation) but in case this project will have real DB
